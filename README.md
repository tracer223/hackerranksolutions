Solutions to various problems on Hackerrank.com

These solutions were compiled, debugged and tested on Hackerrank.com, then the same on my 2009 Macbook Pro. The .json tasks
refer to an older version of C++ because my machine is old and I'm using C++11 to solve these problems locally on my Macbook. 
If you want to run these on your machine, keep that in mind and update the .json files to the latest version of C++. Easiest 
way to do this on Mac is to install Xcode.
