# hackerranksolutions (C++)
Solutions to various problems on Hackerrank.com

These solutions were compiled, debugged and tested on Hackerrank.com, then the same on my 2009 Macbook Pro using VScode, not Xcode as my editor. 
The .json tasks refer to an older version of C++ because my machine is old and I'm using C++11 to solve these problems locally on my Macbook. 
If you want to run these on your machine, keep that in mind and update the .json files to the latest version of C++. Easiest 
way to do this on Mac is to install Xcode.

That being said I highly recommend you don't clone this repo and try to run these programs unless you really know what you're doing with C++, MacOS and VScode. Just copy and paste the main .cpp files into your C++ editor of choice.

Why C++? It's a language that fascinates me. C++ is powerful enough to code your own game engine, create/modify an Operating System, all kinds of cool stuff. I just want to learn it, even if it isn't what I work with every day. I figured I'd do this for fun as a sort of side project. Hoping I don't blow up my laptop in the process.
