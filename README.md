# hackerranksolutions (C++)

Problems I've solved from Hackerrank.com using C++.

to run using bash terminal:
```cd hackerranksolutions
cd /solution folder you'd like to compile, run, etc.
g++ nameOfTheSolution.cpp
./a.out
```

Why C++? It's a language that fascinates me. C++ is powerful enough to code your own game engine, create/modify an OS, etc. I just want to learn it, even if it isn't what I work with every day. I figured I'd do this for fun as a sort of side project.
